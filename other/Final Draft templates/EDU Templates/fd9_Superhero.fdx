    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph Type="Action">
      <Text>Within each Save the Cat! genre are fifteen beats. These beats are important scenes or sequences that typically occur near the same place in every script or movie.</Text>
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph Type="Action">
      <Text>The page number where a beat typically occurs is indicated below in parentheses. This page number is based on a 110-page script. If your script is longer or shorter than 110 pages, the location of your beats may vary.</Text>
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph Type="Action">
      <Text>It's also good to note that, as can be seen in a few of the examples, while the beats usually follow a specific pattern and occur at certain moments in a script, it is not always the case - the order of beats can sometimes vary. There are times the beats can be considered "movable parts" that work together to tell a story - and the transformation of your hero - in the best possible way.</Text>
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph Type="Action">
      <Text>This allows screenwriters to maintain your own unique creative voices while still providing your audience with a familiar form of storytelling that will resonate.</Text>
