    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph Type="Action">
      <Text>Within each Save the Cat! genre are fifteen beats. These beats are important scenes or sequences that typically occur near the same place in every script or movie.</Text>
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph Type="Action">
      <Text>The page number where a beat typically occurs is indicated below in parentheses. This page number is based on a 110-page script. If your script is longer or shorter than 110 pages, the location of your beats may vary.</Text>
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph Type="Action">
      <Text>It's also good to note that, as can be seen in a few of the examples, while the beats usually follow a specific pattern and occur at certain moments in a script, it is not always the case - the order of beats can sometimes vary. There are times the beats can be considered "movable parts" that work together to tell a story - and the transformation of your hero - in the best possible way.</Text>
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph Type="Action">
      <Text>This allows screenwriters to maintain your own unique creative voices while still providing your audience with a familiar form of storytelling that will resonate.</Text>

    <Paragraph Type="Action">
      <Text>Can you erase the memory of love and defy fate? As Joel re-lives that mailroom scene, we flash back to how he learned of this amazing process. A friend (David Cross) tells Joel that Lacuna Inc. erased Clementine's memory of him. Joel storms into the ramshackle office, meets perky office assistant Mary (Kirsten Dunst) and the inventor of the Lacuna procedure, Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson). Joel demands an explanation and learns that Clementine wanted him gone.</Text>

      <Text>As Gil begs off from a night of dancing with Inez and Paul, he finds himself lost in the streets of Paris. When the clock strikes midnight, Gil is approached by a horse-drawn cart that offers him a ride. He thinks nothing of it and gets on board. He’s brought to a party where he meets F. Scott Fitzgerald and his girlfriend Zelda. Initially skeptical, Gil then meets Ernest Hemingway in a café and realizes he’s somehow been magically transported back to the 1920s.</Text>
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph Type="Action">
      <Text>Gil musters up the courage to ask Hemingway to read his book, but Hemingway rejects the idea. He’ll never read the work of another writer. But he tells Gil he’ll give his novel to the only reader he trusts, Gertrude Stein. Gil can’t believe it and goes for some fresh air. But when he tries to return to the café, it’s gone. He’s back in the present.</Text>
