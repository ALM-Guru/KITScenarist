    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph Type="Action">
      <Text>Within each Save the Cat! genre are fifteen beats. These beats are important scenes or sequences that typically occur near the same place in every script or movie.</Text>
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph Type="Action">
      <Text>The page number where a beat typically occurs is indicated below in parentheses. This page number is based on a 110-page script. If your script is longer or shorter than 110 pages, the location of your beats may vary.</Text>
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph Type="Action">
      <Text>It's also good to note that, as can be seen in a few of the examples, while the beats usually follow a specific pattern and occur at certain moments in a script, it is not always the case - the order of beats can sometimes vary. There are times the beats can be considered "movable parts" that work together to tell a story - and the transformation of your hero - in the best possible way.</Text>
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph Type="Action">
      <Text>This allows screenwriters to maintain your own unique creative voices while still providing your audience with a familiar form of storytelling that will resonate.</Text>

    <Paragraph Type="Action">
      <Text>After their first chance meeting, Ned returns to the beachfront walkway site of the encounter hoping to run into Matty again. Even though he has other female companionship, he can’t seem to get Matty off his mind and finally tracks her down at a bar in her more upscale neighborhood. Their flirtation sizzles, her husband is out of town, and when he follows her home to “see her wind chimes,” they end up in bed.</Text>

But then Ned is contacted by Edmund's lawyer about a new will that Ned supposedly drew up on Edmund's behalf, which was witnessed by Mary Ann Simpson. Unaware of the new will's existence, Ned plays along to avoid suspicion. Still leaving half the estate to Heather, the new will is so poorly prepared it is declared null and void due to a violation of the rule against perpetuities.
